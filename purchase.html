						<li>Transaction Fees. Buyer acknowledges and understands that any transactions in the Tokens effected using the SAFE HAVEN Protocol may subject to transaction fees payable in SHA set by the SAFE HAVEN Protocol, which may vary from time to time.</li>
						<li>Not an Offering of Investment, Securities, Commodities, or Swaps. Buyer acknowledges and understands that: (a) the sale of Tokens and the Tokens themselves are not investments, currencies, securities, commodities, swaps on a currency, security or commodity, or a financial asset or instrument of any kind; (b) purchases and sales of Tokens are not subject to the protections of any laws governing those types of financial instruments; and (c) this Agreement and all other documents referred to in this Agreement, including the Whitepaper, do not constitute a prospectus or offering document, and are not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer to buy an investment, a currency, a security, commodity, or a swap on either a security or commodity or a financial asset or instrument of any kind.</li>

                    <h3>BUYER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OF RISKS</h3>
					TOKENS MAY HAVE NO VALUE. BUYER MAY LOSE ALL AMOUNTS PAID. Buyer has carefully reviewed, acknowledges, understands and assumes the following risks, as well as all other risks associated with the Tokens (including those not discussed herein), all of which could render the Tokens worthless or of little value:
					<ol class=numbered-list>
                        <li>Basis for Purchase. Purchasing Tokens is at Buyer’s sole risk and that the Tokens are each provided, used and acquired on an “AS IS” and on an “AS AVAILABLE” basis without representations, warranties, promises or guarantees whatsoever of any kind by Company. Buyer must rely on its own examination and investigation thereof.</li>
						<li>No Rights, Functionality or Features. Tokens have no rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, outside the Project.</li>
						<li>Project. Tokens may not be usable on the Project and do not entitle Buyer to anything with respect to the Project.</li>
						<li>Purchase Price Risk. There are no guarantees as to the price of Tokens purchased by Buyer and no guarantees that the price per Token determined by the market will be equal to or higher. There is the possibility that the price per Token may fall below the price paid by initial buyers of Tokens during the initial distribution period. Company reserves the right to change the duration of any timeframe for the distribution of Tokens, including, without limitation, the unavailability or non-functionality of the Website or other unforeseen procedural or security issues.</li>
						<li>Blockchain Delay Risk. On the SAFE HAVEN Protocol, transactions may not be recorded in the last-closed ledger until the transaction has been ratified through the SAFE HAVEN consensus algorithm. Timing of ratification may occur at random times. For example, Token transfers in a given open ledger may not be included in the next last-closed ledger, and may be included in the candidate set for the beginning of the consensus process on the next open ledger. As a result, the last-closed ledger may not include Buyer’s transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive Tokens on the same day Buyer purchases the Tokens.</li>
						<li>SAFE HAVEN Consensus Ledger. Transactions on the SAFE HAVEN Consensus Ledger may be delayed or lost due to operational error or malicious attacks by third parties. Buyer acknowledges and understands that the last-closed ledger may not include Buyer’s transaction when Buyer wants or expects and that Buyer’s transaction may be excluded or discarded entirely.</li>
						<li>Operational Error. Buyer may never receive Tokens and may lose the entire amount Buyer paid to Company for such Tokens as a result of interruptions and operational errors in the process of purchasing or receiving the Tokens.</li>
						<li>Ability to Transact or Resell. Buyer may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in Tokens at any time, or for the price Buyer paid due to (a) diminution in value of the Tokens; (b) lack of liquidity for the Tokens; or (c) Company imposing restricts on the transferability of the Tokens.</li>
						<li>Token Security. Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the SAFE HAVEN Protocol rests on open source software and Tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk that SAFE HAVEN Protocol may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Tokens or result in the loss of Buyer’s Tokens, the loss of Buyer’s ability to access or control Buyer’s Tokens or the loss of any other assets in Buyer’s account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.</li>
						<li>Access to Private Keys. Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in Buyer’s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Buyer’s digital wallet or vault storing Tokens may result in loss of such Tokens, access to Buyer’s Token balance or any balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service Buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate Buyer’s Tokens. Company is not responsible for any such losses.</li>
						<li>New Technology. The Project and all of the matters set forth in the Whitepaper are new and untested. The Project might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption. Even if the Project is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the Project may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the Tokens and the Project may become outdated.</li>
						<li>Tax Consequences. The purchase and receipt of Tokens may have tax consequences for Buyer. Buyer is solely responsible for Buyer’s compliance with Buyer’s tax obligations.</li>
						<li>Reliance on Third-Parties. Even if completed, the Project may rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone’s needs, all of might have a material adverse effect on the Project.</li>
						<li>Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer’s Account. Failure of Buyer to map a public key to Buyer’s account may result in third parties being unable to recognize Buyer’s Token balance on the SAFE HAVEN Consensus Ledger.</li>
						<li>Exchange & Counterparty Risks. If Buyer chooses to maintain or hold Tokens through a third party, Buyer’s Tokens may be stolen or lost. In addition, third parties may not recognize Buyer’s claim to any derivative tokens if and when launched by third parties according to the distribution rules set in the Project. Buyer holds Tokens through a third party at Buyer’s own and sole risk.</li>
						<li>Changes to the Project. The Project is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although Company intends for the Project to have the features and specifications set forth in the Whitepaper, Company may make changes to such features and specifications for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that the Project does not meet Buyer’s expectations. As a result: (a) the Project may never be completed; (b) the Project may not be completed as initially proposed by Company, and in a different or modified form; (c) a blockchain utilizing or adopting features of the Project may ever be launched; and (d) a blockchain may never be launched with or without changes to the Project.</li>
						<li>Project Completion. The development of the Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.</li>
						<li>Lack of Interest. Even if the Project is finished, launched and adopted, the ongoing success of the Project relies on the interest and participation of third parties. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the Project.</li>
						<li>Uncertain Regulatory Framework. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities may regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations or rules that may affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. Company may cease the distribution of Tokens, the development of the Project or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.</li>
						<li>Risk of Government Action. The industry in which Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Company or pursue enforcement actions against Company. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular. All of this may subject Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Tokens or the development of the Project.</li>
